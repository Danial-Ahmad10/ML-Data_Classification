# ML-Data_Classification
A beginning exercise into the world of Machine Learning! An exciting and refreshing classification problem that draws a Hypothesis line around data. 

Some prominent features:
- Generating a Dataset: Using the random function to generate a bunch of random values and then assigning them either '+' or '-' as classes.

- Drawing Class boundary: We set a class boundary and draw a rectangle to visualize the Class Boundary.

- Estimating General and Specific Hypothesis: We draw a rectangle to classify the hypothesis boundary line that is to be predicted by the ML model. We create a Specific(S) which is as close to the positive points as possible. After that, we create a General (G) that is as near the negative points as possible without including them.

Using this basic algorithm, we learn how the model will separate classes from a Dataset and the range of boundaries it can create.
